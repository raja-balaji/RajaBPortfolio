            Designed and developed a full-stack web application using Node.js,
            React, and MongoDB. Focused on creating an engaging platform where
            users could simulate gambling experiences, which required
            implementing secure backend logic, dynamic frontend interactions,
            and seamless database integration. Implemented authentication,
            real-time updates, and user-friendly UI components to enhance the
            overall experience. This project provided me with a solid foundation
            in full-stack development and a valuable learning experience in
            building scalable web applications.

            <br />
            Conducted extensive research on computer components and their
            compatibility, followed by careful selection of parts within budget.
            Successfully assembled the PC and installed the operating system
            and all necessary drivers. This hands-on project provided valuable
            experience in setting up both hardware and software, giving me a
            strong foundation in computer systems and integration.
